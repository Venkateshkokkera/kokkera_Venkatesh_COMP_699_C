## System Request  

The Smart Health Tracker project aims to create a simple, web-based health monitoring system that helps individuals track their daily wellness without relying on expensive wearable devices. The system will allow users to log their heart rate, BMI, and sleep patterns while providing real-time dashboards and visual trends. It also includes a predictive analysis feature that uses synthetic data to simulate realistic health conditions and trigger alerts when readings move beyond safe thresholds. This predictive capability is designed to raise early awareness of potential health issues and encourage preventive action.

## System Overview  

Kokkera Digital Health Solutions is a conceptual start-up developed for this academic project. The company’s goal is to design an accessible and privacy-focused platform that supports proactive health management. Users will be able to sign up, log daily data, view personalized dashboards, and download health reports. The system’s predictive engine runs locally, analyzing stored values to identify abnormal trends and generate notifications. Admin users will have access to manage accounts, upload synthetic datasets, and view overall system statistics. The application demonstrates how simple data-driven systems can support public health improvement through continuous self-monitoring and predictive insights.

## Technological Tools Overview  

The Smart Health Tracker will be developed using **Python** for backend logic and **Flask** as the lightweight web framework. **HTML** and **CSS** will be used for the user interface to ensure a clean and responsive design. The database layer will use **SQLite** for data storage during demonstration. **Matplotlib** or **Plotly** libraries will be used to generate charts and trends, while **NumPy** and **Pandas** will support data manipulation and rolling-average calculations for the predictive module. Version control and collaboration will be managed through **GitHub**.

## 6. Preliminary Design and Implementation Ideas  

The Smart Health Tracker will be built using Python as the main programming language. The backend will use the Flask framework to handle user login, save health data, run risk checks, and create alerts. The user interface will be made with HTML and CSS pages that are loaded through Flask to keep the design simple and easy to use. All user details and health records will be stored in a SQLite database for safe and quick access. The predictive part of the system will use Python logic to review past data, calculate averages, and find unusual patterns. If any reading crosses the set limits, the system will create an alert and show it on the dashboard. This design keeps the system clear, manageable, and within the allowed tools for this project.
