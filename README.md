Smart Health Tracker – System Proposal
Author: Venkatesh Kokkera

System Request

The Smart Health Tracker project aims to create a simple, web-based health monitoring system that helps individuals track their daily wellness without relying on expensive wearable devices. The system will allow users to log their heart rate, BMI, and sleep patterns while providing real-time dashboards and visual trends. It also includes a predictive analysis feature that uses synthetic data to simulate realistic health conditions and trigger alerts when readings move beyond safe thresholds. This predictive capability is designed to raise early awareness of potential health issues and encourage preventive action.

System Overview

Kokkera Digital Health Solutions is a conceptual start-up developed for this academic project. The company’s goal is to design an accessible and privacy-focused platform that supports proactive health management. Users will be able to sign up, log daily data, view personalized dashboards, and download health reports. The system’s predictive engine runs locally, analyzing stored values to identify abnormal trends and generate notifications. Admin users will have access to manage accounts, upload synthetic datasets, and view overall system statistics. The application demonstrates how simple data-driven systems can support public health improvement through continuous self-monitoring and predictive insights.

Technological Tools Overview

The Smart Health Tracker will be developed using Python for backend logic and Flask as the lightweight web framework. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used for the user interface, providing interactive dashboards and visual reports. The database layer will use SQLite for data storage during demonstration. Matplotlib or Plotly libraries will be used to generate charts and trends, while NumPy and Pandas will support data manipulation and rolling-average calculations for the predictive module. Version control and collaboration will be managed through GitHub.
